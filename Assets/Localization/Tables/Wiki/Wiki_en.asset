      main difference in Echo behaviour comes from whether or not they are combat

      or not they can also complete tasks. \n\nA combat enabled Echo that does NOT

      enabled Echo that DOES have the ability to do tasks will prioritize tasks over
      combat and only engage enemies that see them.\n\nEchoes that do not have combat
      will not be targetted by or target enemies.\n\nDev Note | Right now there are
      no echoes in the game that can do both combat and tasks. Echoes from Milestones
      specifically seek out tasks for that skills milestone EG an echo spawned with
      woodcutting will only seek out woodcutting tasks."
