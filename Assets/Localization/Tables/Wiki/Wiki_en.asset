      Reaching your 10th, 100th,
      1,000th, and 10,000th kill against a specific enemy will grant you 25% bonus
      damage against that specific enemy. This is where the majority of the green
      damage you see comes from.'

    m_Localized: "Echoes are alternate versions of Caleb who will shift slightly
      into his reality to help out under various circumstances.\n\nEach echo can
      have a combination of Calebs skillset. But most Echoes won't have them all.\n\nThe
      main difference in Echo behaviour comes from whether or not they are combat
      enabled.\nCombat enabled Echoes have two different styles depending on whether
      or not they can also complete tasks. \n\nA combat enabled Echo that does NOT
      have the ability to do tasks will seek out enemies specifically.\nA combat
      enabled Echo that DOES have the ability to do tasks will prioritize tasks over
      combat and only engage enemies that see them.\n\nEchoes that do not have combat
      will not be targetted by or target enemies.\n\nDev Note | Right now there are
      no echoes in the game that can do both combat and tasks. Echoes from Milestones
      specifically seek out tasks for that skills milestone EG an echo spawned with
      woodcutting will only seek out woodcutting tasks."
